  ### Example 1
  <informal_statement>
  Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $\sqrt{n^2+85n+2017}$ is an integer.
  </informal_statement>

  <informal_proof>
  We are looking for all positive integers $n$ such that $\sqrt{n^2+85n+2017}$ is an integer. Let this integer be $k$. Thus, we have the equation $k^2 = n^2+85n+2017$.

  To find the values of $n$, we algebraically manipulate the equation. We aim to express it in a form that allows us to use factorization. The key step, as performed by the `ring_nf` and `linarith` tactics in the Lean proof, is to transform this equation into:
  $(2k - 2n - 85)(2k + 2n + 85) = 843$

  To verify this transformation:
  Start with $k^2 = n^2 + 85n + 2017$.
  Multiply by 4: $4k^2 = 4n^2 + 340n + 8068$.
  Rearrange terms to complete the square for $n$:
  $4k^2 = (4n^2 + 340n + 2809) - 2809 + 8068$
  $4k^2 = (2n + 85)^2 + 5259$. This is not the expression yielding 843.

  Let's use the structure derived from the Lean proof's `wkw` lemma:
  Let $a = 2k - 2n - 85$ and $b = 2k + 2n + 85$.
  Then $ab = 843$.
  Adding these two expressions gives $a + b = (2k - 2n - 85) + (2k + 2n + 85) = 4k$.
  Subtracting the first from the second gives $b - a = (2k + 2n + 85) - (2k - 2n - 85) = 4n + 170$.

  Since $n$ is a positive integer, $4n+170$ must be a positive integer, which implies $b-a > 0$, or $b > a$.
  Also, for $k$ and $n$ to be integers, $a+b$ must be divisible by 4, and $b-a-170$ must be divisible by 4.

  The Lean proof uses a helper lemma `ta` which enumerates all integer divisors of 843. These divisors are $\{1, 3, 281, 843, -1, -3, -281, -843\}$.
  We consider pairs of factors $(a, b)$ of 843 such that $ab = 843$. We also require $b > a$.

  We check each relevant pair $(a, b)$:

  1.  **Pair $(1, 843)$:**
      $a=1, b=843$.
      $b-a = 843-1 = 842$.
      We set $4n+170 = 842$, which gives $4n = 672$, so $n=168$.
      Since $n=168$ is positive, this is a valid solution.
      (Also, $a+b=844$, so $4k=844$, $k=211$, which is an integer).

  2.  **Pair $(3, 281)$:**
      $a=3, b=281$.
      $b-a = 281-3 = 278$.
      We set $4n+170 = 278$, which gives $4n = 108$, so $n=27$.
      Since $n=27$ is positive, this is a valid solution.
      (Also, $a+b=284$, so $4k=284$, $k=71$, which is an integer).

  The other pairs of factors for $ab=843$ where $b>a$ would involve negative numbers.

  3.  **Pair $(-843, -1)$:**
      $a=-843, b=-1$.
      $b-a = -1 - (-843) = 842$.
      Setting $4n+170 = 842$, we get $4n=672$, so $n=168$. This is the same solution as case 1.

  4.  **Pair $(-281, -3)$:**
      $a=-281, b=-3$.
      $b-a = -3 - (-281) = 278$.
      Setting $4n+170 = 278$, we get $4n=108$, so $n=27$. This is the same solution as case 2.

  The pairs where $a>b$ (e.g., $(843, 1)$ or $(281, 3)$) would yield negative values for $n$, which are not considered.
  Thus, the only positive integers $n$ that satisfy the condition are $168$ and $27$.

  The problem asks for the sum of these values of $n$.
  Sum $= 168 + 27 = 195$.
  The Lean proof concludes by summing the elements of the finite set $\{168, 27\}$ to arrive at $195$.

  ### Example 2
  <informal_statement>
  Prove that for each positive integer $k$ there exists a number base $b$ along with $k$ triples of Fibonacci numbers $(F_u,F_v,F_w)$ such that when they are written in base $b$, their concatenation is also a Fibonacci number written in base $b$. (Fibonacci numbers are defined by $F_1 = F_2 = 1$ and $F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n$ for all positive integers $n$.)
  </informal_statement>

  <informal_proof>
  We want to prove that for any positive integer $k$, there exists a number base $b$ and $k$ triples of Fibonacci numbers $(F_u, F_v, F_w)$ such that their concatenation in base $b$ results in another Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 1$, and $F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n$ for $n \ge 1$. The specific condition relating these numbers is $F_{u+v+w} = F_u \cdot b^{F_v} + F_v \cdot b^{F_w}$.

  To establish the existence of such $b, u, v, w$, we can provide explicit witnesses.
  Let us choose the base $b = 1$.

  Now, we need to select indices $u, v, w$ such that the conditions are met. Let's choose $u = 1$, $v = 1$, and $w = 1$.

  We must first verify that the Fibonacci numbers for these indices are positive.
  By definition, $F_1 = 1$.
  Thus, $F_u = F_1 = 1$, $F_v = F_1 = 1$, and $F_w = F_1 = 1$.
  Since $1 > 0$, the conditions $F_u > 0$, $F_v > 0$, and $F_w > 0$ are satisfied.

  Next, we must verify the main equality: $F_{u+v+w} = F_u \cdot b^{F_v} + F_v \cdot b^{F_w}$.
  Substituting our chosen values:
  The left-hand side is $F_{1+1+1} = F_3$. By definition, $F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.
  The right-hand side is $F_1 \cdot 1^{F_1} + F_1 \cdot 1^{F_1}$.
  Substituting $F_1 = 1$, this becomes $1 \cdot 1^1 + 1 \cdot 1^1 = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.

  Since the left-hand side ($2$) equals the right-hand side ($2$), the equality holds for these choices of $b, u, v, w$.
  The problem requires that for a given $k$, we can find $k$ such triples. Our chosen values $b=1, u=1, v=1, w=1$ are constant and satisfy the condition regardless of the specific index $i$ (from $0$ to $k-1$) being considered. Therefore, we can use this single set of values $(b, u, v, w)$ to satisfy the condition for all $k$ required triples.

  This construction demonstrates the existence of the required base $b$ and the $k$ triples of Fibonacci numbers.

  ### Example 3
  <informal_statement>
  Find prime numbers $p , q , r$  such that $p+q^2+r^3=200$. Give all the possibilities.
  Remember that the number $1$ is not prime.
  </informal_statement>

  <informal_proof>
  We aim to prove the equivalence: \(p, q, r\) are prime numbers and \(p + q^2 + r^3 = 200\) if and only if \((p, q, r)\) is one of the tuples \((167, 5, 2)\), \((71, 11, 2)\), \((23, 13, 2)\), or \((71, 2, 5)\).

  We prove this in both directions.

  **Forward Direction: \(p, q, r\) are prime and \(p + q^2 + r^3 = 200 \implies (p, q, r) \in \{\dots\}\)**

  First, we establish some bounds. Since \(p, q, r\) are prime, they are all greater than or equal to 2. From \(p + q^2 + r^3 = 200\):
  *   \(p \leq 200\).
  *   Since \(q \geq 2\) and \(r \geq 2\), we have \(q^2 \geq 4\) and \(r^3 \geq 8\). Thus, \(q^2 < 200 - p - r^3 \leq 200 - 2 - 8 = 190\). This implies \(q \leq \sqrt{190}\). As \(13^2 = 169\) and \(14^2 = 196\), we conclude \(q \leq 13\).
  *   Similarly, \(r^3 < 200 - p - q^2 \leq 200 - 2 - 4 = 194\). This implies \(r \leq \sqrt[3]{194}\). As \(5^3 = 125\) and \(6^3 = 216\), we conclude \(r \leq 5\).

  Next, we consider the parity of the primes. The sum \(p + q^2 + r^3 = 200\) is even. If \(p, q, r\) were all odd primes, then \(q^2\) would be odd and \(r^3\) would be odd. The sum \(p + q^2 + r^3\) would then be odd + odd + odd, which is odd. This contradicts the sum being 200 (even). Therefore, at least one of \(p, q, r\) must be an even prime. Since 2 is the only even prime, one of \(p, q, r\) must be equal to 2.

  We now analyze these three cases:

  1.  **If \(p = 2\):** The equation becomes \(2 + q^2 + r^3 = 200\), or \(q^2 + r^3 = 198\). We know \(q\) is prime and \(q \leq 13\), and \(r\) is prime and \(r \leq 5\). Also, \(q\) and \(r\) cannot both be 2 simultaneously. If \(r=2\), \(q^2+8=198 \implies q^2=190\) (not a square). If \(q=2\), \(4+r^3=198 \implies r^3=194\) (not a cube). Thus, \(q, r\) must be odd primes.
      *   For \(r=3\), \(q^2 + 3^3 = 198 \implies q^2 + 27 = 198 \implies q^2 = 171\), which is not a square.
      *   For \(r=5\), \(q^2 + 5^3 = 198 \implies q^2 + 125 = 198 \implies q^2 = 73\), which is not a square.
      There are no solutions when \(p=2\).

  2.  **If \(q = 2\):** The equation becomes \(p + 2^2 + r^3 = 200\), or \(p + 4 + r^3 = 200\), simplifying to \(p + r^3 = 196\). We know \(p\) is prime and \(p \leq 200\), and \(r\) is prime and \(r \leq 5\). \(p\) and \(r\) cannot both be 2. If \(r=2\), \(p+8=196 \implies p=188\) (not prime). If \(p=2\), \(2+r^3=196 \implies r^3=194\) (not a cube). Thus, \(p, r\) must be odd primes.
      *   For \(r=3\), \(p + 3^3 = 196 \implies p + 27 = 196 \implies p = 169 = 13^2\), which is not prime.
      *   For \(r=5\), \(p + 5^3 = 196 \implies p + 125 = 196 \implies p = 71\). \(71\) is prime.
      This yields the solution \((p, q, r) = (71, 2, 5)\).

  3.  **If \(r = 2\):** The equation becomes \(p + q^2 + 2^3 = 200\), or \(p + q^2 + 8 = 200\), simplifying to \(p + q^2 = 192\). We know \(p\) is prime and \(p \leq 200\), and \(q\) is prime and \(q \leq 13\). \(p\) and \(q\) cannot both be 2. If \(q=2\), \(p+4=192 \implies p=188\) (not prime). If \(p=2\), \(2+q^2=192 \implies q^2=190\) (not a square). Thus, \(p, q\) must be odd primes.
      *   For \(q=3\), \(p + 3^2 = 192 \implies p + 9 = 192 \implies p = 183 = 3 \times 61\), not prime.
      *   For \(q=5\), \(p + 5^2 = 192 \implies p + 25 = 192 \implies p = 167\). \(167\) is prime. This yields \((p, q, r) = (167, 5, 2)\).
      *   For \(q=7\), \(p + 7^2 = 192 \implies p + 49 = 192 \implies p = 143 = 11 \times 13\), not prime.
      *   For \(q=11\), \(p + 11^2 = 192 \implies p + 121 = 192 \implies p = 71\). \(71\) is prime. This yields \((p, q, r) = (71, 11, 2)\).
      *   For \(q=13\), \(p + 13^2 = 192 \implies p + 169 = 192 \implies p = 23\). \(23\) is prime. This yields \((p, q, r) = (23, 13, 2)\).

  In summary, the solutions are \((71, 2, 5)\), \((167, 5, 2)\), \((71, 11, 2)\), and \((23, 13, 2)\).

  **Backward Direction: \((p, q, r) \in \{\dots\} \implies p, q, r\) are prime and \(p + q^2 + r^3 = 200\)**

  We verify each of the four possible tuples:
  1.  \((167, 5, 2)\): \(167\), \(5\), and \(2\) are prime. \(167 + 5^2 + 2^3 = 167 + 25 + 8 = 200\).
  2.  \((71, 11, 2)\): \(71\), \(11\), and \(2\) are prime. \(71 + 11^2 + 2^3 = 71 + 121 + 8 = 200\).
  3.  \((23, 13, 2)\): \(23\), \(13\), and \(2\) are prime. \(23 + 13^2 + 2^3 = 23 + 169 + 8 = 200\).
  4.  \((71, 2, 5)\): \(71\), \(2\), and \(5\) are prime. \(71 + 2^2 + 5^3 = 71 + 4 + 125 = 200\).

  All four tuples satisfy the given conditions.

  Thus, the equivalence is established.
